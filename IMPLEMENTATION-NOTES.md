# Bred's Portfolio - Implementation Notes 🎨

Welcome! This document is designed to help you understand how your portfolio is built, so you can make changes, add new art, or even redesign it completely in the future.

The project is built using the three core technologies of the web:
1.  **HTML** (`index.html`): The skeleton and content.
2.  **CSS** (`style.css`): The skin, makeup, and layout.
3.  **JavaScript** (`script.js`): The brain and behavior.

---

## 1. HTML (`index.html`)

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) organizes your content.

*   **Structure**: The site is divided into semantic sections:
    *   `<header>`: The hero section with your avatar and intro.
    *   `<main>`: The primary content, containing your gallery and pricing.
    *   `<section>`: Logical groups like `#gallery`, `#pricing`, `#tos`.
    *   `<footer>`: The bottom area with contact links.
*   **Lazy Loading**: You'll notice `loading="lazy"` on gallery images. This tells the browser not to download the image until the user scrolls near it, making the site load faster.
*   **The Lightbox**: At the very bottom, there's a `<div id="lightbox">`. It's hidden by default and only shows up when you click an image.

## 2. CSS (`style.css`)

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls how everything looks.

*   **Variables (`:root`)**: At the top of the file, we define colors and fonts once (e.g., `--accent: #916A5D;`). If you want to change the theme color, you only need to change it here!
*   **CSS Grid**: The gallery uses `display: grid`. It automatically arranges your artwork into columns that fit the screen size.
    *   `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))` means "fit as many 250px-wide columns as possible."
*   **Noise Texture**: The `body::before` block creates that cool grainy paper texture in the background using a clever SVG trick and a gradient.
*   **Hover Effects**: Look for blocks with `:hover`. These define what happens when you put your mouse over something (like images zooming in slightly).

## 3. JavaScript (`script.js`)

JavaScript handles interactivity.

*   **Event Listeners**: The code "listens" for user actions (clicks).
*   **The Lightbox**:
    1.  We find all images in the gallery.
    2.  We add a click listener to each one.
    3.  When clicked, we take that image's `src` and put it into the lightbox `<img src="...">`, then show the lightbox.
*   **Clipboard Copy**: The Discord button uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` to copy your username to the user's clipboard. It then temporarily shows a "Copied!" message.

## Note on Maintenance

This project was originally generated by a script (`scaffold_portfolio.sh`). Now that you are maintaining it, you should likely **edit the files directly** (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).

If you run the scaffold script again, it might overwrite your changes, so proceed with caution or rely on these files as your new source of truth!

Happy coding! 🚀
