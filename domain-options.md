This is a great list to work from. When choosing a domain, the "first-year sale" is a nice bonus, but since this is a portfolio she’ll likely keep for years, the **renewal price** is the most important number.

Here is a breakdown of your best options based on branding, "cool factor," and long-term value.

### 1. The "Perfect Match": `dementedbred.art`

* **Cost:** $3.60 (1st year) | **$21.11 (Renewal)**
* **Why:** It is the most descriptive TLD for a portfolio. It tells clients exactly what to expect. At ~$21/year for renewal, it’s a mid-range price for a very high-quality brand signal.

### 2. The "Clever Hack": `dementedb.red`

* **Cost:** $8.24 (1st year) | **$19.05 (Renewal)**
* **Why:** This is objectively the "coolest" option. It uses the `.red` TLD to complete the brand name. It’s shorter, memorable, and fits the "demented" aesthetic perfectly. The renewal price is also slightly cheaper than the `.art` extension.

### 3. The "Tech Flex": `dementedbred.dev` or `dementedbred.xyz`

* **`dementedbred.dev`:** $10.81 (1st year) | **$12.87 (Renewal)**
* **`dementedbred.xyz`:** $2.04 (1st year) | **$12.98 (Renewal)**
* **Why:** These are the best value options. They have the lowest long-term renewal rates in your list. Since you built this with a sophisticated stack (Astro, NeonDB, Vercel), a `.dev` or `.xyz` extension signals that this is a modern, custom-built application rather than a template site.

### 4. The "Professional Studio": `dementedbred.studio`

* **Cost:** $11.84 (1st year) | **$25.23 (Renewal)**
* **Why:** If she plans to take commissions or sell work, `.studio` sounds more like a business than a personal project. It carries a bit more "weight" than `.art`.

### ⚠️ Watch out for "The Renewal Trap"

Several of the options with the cheapest $1.54 entry price have much higher renewals. Avoid these unless she really loves the name:

* **`.space`, `.lol`, `.pics`, `.online**`: These all jump to **$26–$28/year** upon renewal. Over 5 years, you’ll end up paying significantly more than you would for the `.dev` or `.art` options.

### My Top 3 Recommendations

| Rank | Domain | Vibe | Long-Term Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **#1** | **`dementedb.red`** | The "Domain Hack" – Super creative & unique. | Great ($19.05) |
| **#2** | **`dementedbred.art`** | The Industry Standard – Clear & Professional. | Good ($21.11) |
| **#3** | **`dementedbred.dev`** | The Builder – Shows off the custom tech stack. | **Best ($12.87)** |

**Pro-tip:** Since you're using Vercel, once you buy the domain on Porkbun, you just need to point the **A records** and **CNAME** to Vercel's edge network.

Would you like me to generate the specific DNS records you'll need to copy-paste into Porkbun once you've made your choice?
